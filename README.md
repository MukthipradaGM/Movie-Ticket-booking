MOVIE TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM
Watching movies with family and friends has always been everybodyâ€™s favourite
hobby. This project is aimed at developing a movie ticket booking system for a Cinema Hall.
The movie ticket booking system is an application that can be accessed throughout by all its
users. This application will automate the reservation of movie tickets.
This ticket reservation system provides a command prompt for a cinema hall where
any user can access it from the place where they are. The existing system has two ways of
booking tickets for a movie, one is to book tickets at the ticket counter of the respective
cinema hall and the other one is through computers with any kind of operating systems like
windows/Linux/MacOs. Former is one of the hectic processes where one should stand in long
queues for hours.All this becomes a highly tedious job.Automating everything remains our
primary concern which led to the development of this website.This has both admin and user
privileges giving more personalized experience.
